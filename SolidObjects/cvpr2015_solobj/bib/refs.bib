annote = {-Inverse polar octree:
-Voxel {\&}gt; mesh for fusion
-Inverse polar transformation to avoid nonuniform voxel quantization: convert to spherical coords from euclidean, invert depth, now infinite world mapped to finite sphere. now uniform quantization since estimation error bounded. Since estimation error is constant*depth, with inverse depth this becomes bounded. 
-In polar map, errors past max dist bounded by constant/maxdist, so have useful quant size related to depth error. Therefore quant error {\&}gt; estimation error for everything outside max distance -{\&}gt; point should be contained within one voxel, no spurious voxels!
-Map infinite space into finite memory. Problem: Nonuniform quantization error, transformations between viewopints difficult, may map single voxel to multiple after viewpoint change.
-Asusmptions of small quant noise change and multiple inverse polar octress used to deal with the resampling? Small motions easier to deal with and cause less error in tree. }

-Stereo/scene flow extends optical flow to time, joint estimate of matches and flow
-"disparity transfer" for prediction of disparity maps
-Homography between projections i ndisparity map for predicting new frame?
-Compare predicted and measured disparities, align to integer values??
-Seed growing algorithm used to fill in places without good predictions?
-Impressive results
-Assumption of constant disparity between viewpoints, so... very small motions?
-Looks like they're not really doing it in disparity space... propagating disparity maps by estimating reprojection after motion, assuming disparity will remain constant, and then validating that by looking at similarity of pixel regions to update disparity by integer values.
-Ego motion by VO
