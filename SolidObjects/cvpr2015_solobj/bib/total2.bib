Use the fact that images of Lambertian objects under varying illumination form linear subspaces -> Idea: find K polyhedial cones (or linear subspaces) that fit the data. "Illumination cones" is a bundle-like representation of objects under varying illumination. "Conic affinity" = distance in the equivalence class; the entire database is necessary in order to compute affinity between 2 images. Second method based on processing gradients; aims at small sensitivity (as opposed to invariance) to illumination. Pose is fixed. Exploits the fact that faces have very similar geometry; dismisses using this to estimate direction of incoming light (what if there are more light sources?).. Clustering is "unsupervised" (images are unlabeled). In the process they explain a positivity-constrained least-squares fitting, and a K-subspace clustering algorithm.}

basis elements. They relate to the conditions of Sun et al., where the discrete

are Gaussian, and therefore they can be estimated exactly (?). The same authors

sense, rather than a real hybrid system, this work discusses a number of models
running in parallel, where a Markov chain is used to decide which system to
sample a measurement from. Approximate filtering algorithms are proposed, based
on an ad-hoc choice of model class of conditional densities (in terms of
so-called variational parameters), and ML estimates of the parameter alternate
in an E-M framework. No conditions on identifiability are given.}

  annote = {Physical simulation of dynamic objects has become commonplace in
computer graphics because it produces highly realistic animations. In this
paradigm the animator provides few physical parameters such as the objects'
initial positions and velocities, and the simulator automatically generates
realistic motions. The resulting motion, however, is difficult to control
because even a small adjustment of the input parameters can drastically
affect the subsequent motion. Furthermore, the animator often wishes to
change the end-result of the motion instead of the initial physical
parameters. We describe a novel interactive technique for intuitive
manipulation of rigid multi-body simulations. Using our system, the animator
can select bodies at any time and simply drag them to desired locations. In
response, the system computes the required physical parameters and simulates
the resulting motion. Surface characteristics such as normals and elasticity
coefficients can also be automatically adjusted to provide a greater range
of feasible motions, if the animator so desires. Because the entire
simulation editing process runs at interactive speeds, the animator can
rapidly design complex physical animations that would be difficult to
achieve with existing rigid body simulators. },

  abstract =     {We cast the problem of multiframe stereo
                  reconstruction of a smooth shape as the global region
                  segmentation of a collection of images of the
                  scene. Dually, the problem of segmenting multiple
                  calibrated images of an object becomes that of
                  estimating the solid shape that gives rise to such
                  images. We assume that the radiance has smooth
                  statistics. This assumption covers Lambertian scenes
                  with smooth or constant albedo as well as fine
                  homogeneous textures, which are known challenges to
                  stereo algorithms based on local correspondence. We
                  pose the segmentation problem within a variational
                  framework, and use fast level set methods to
                  approximate the optimal solution numerically. Our
                  algorithm does nor work in the presence of strong
                  textures, where traditional reconstruction algorithms
                  do. It enjoys significant robustness to noise under
                  the assumptions it is designed for.}

In particular, instead of observability being characterized as the existece of a time such that both the continuous and the discrete state can be determined from the output, observability is characterized as the existence of a time and a switching path such that the continuous state alone can be observed. Therefore, these conditions pertain to systems where the discrete state is controlled, rather than evolve out of its own dynamics.}

The same authors have later also considered alternating minimization schemes to also estimate model parameters as well as MCMC schemes to guarantee global convergence. There is, however, no analysis of the conditions under which an estimate actually exists or is unique.}

In this sense, rather than a real hybrid system, this work discusses a number of models running in parallel, where a Markov chain is used to decide which system to sample a measurement from. Approximate filtering algorithms are proposed, based on an ad-hoc choice of model class of conditional densities (in terms of so-called variational parameters), and ML estimates of the parameter alternate in an E-M framework. No conditions on identifiability are given.}

                  (2001. IEEE-IP, 10(2):266?277). The multiphase level
                  set formulation is new and of interest on its own: by
                  construction, it automatically avoids the problems
                  of vacuum and overlap; it needs only log n level set
                  functions for n phases in the piecewise constant

                  formally suffice to represent any partition, based

                  primarily geometrically based motions of these curves

                  changes in the curves (i.e., merging and breaking) to
                  occur. Applications include finding geodesic curves
                  and shortest paths and curve shortening on
                  surfaces. Further applications can be arrived at by
                  extending those for curves moving in R^2 to

                  also be viewed as a simple constraint problem and may

                  passively advected by an un derlying flow. These

                  resem ble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic
                  right-hand-sides, by using techniqu es from the
                  hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes
                  of various ord ers of accuracy are used to solve the
                  equations, providing methods that accurate ly capture
                  the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the

                  merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of

                  two and three views. Multi-view relationships are
                  developed for lines, conics and non-algebraic
                  curves. The new relationships focus on determining the
                  plane of the curve in a projective reconstruction, and
                  in particular using the homography induced by this
                  plane for transfer from one image to another. It is
                  shown that given the fundamental matrix between two
                  views, and images of the curve in each view, then the
                  plane of a conic may be determined up to a two fold
                  ambiguity, but local curvature of a curve uniquely
                  determines the plane. It is then shown that given the
                  trifocal tensor between three views, this plane
                  defines a homography map which may be used to transfer
                  a conic or the curvature from two views to a
                  third. Simple expressions are developed for the plane
                  and homography in each case. A set of algorithms are
                  then described for automatically matching individual
                  line segments and curves between images. The
                  algorithms use both photometric information and the
                  multiple view geometric relationships. For image pairs
                  the homography facilitates the computation of a
                  neighbourhood cross-correlation based matching score
                  for putative line/curve correspondences. For image
                  triplets cross-correlation matching scores are used in
                  conjunction with line/curve transfer based on the
                  trifocal geometry to disambiguate matches. Algorithms
                  are developed for both short and wide baselines. The
                  algorithms are robust to deficiencies in the segment
                  extraction and partial occlusion. Experimental results
                  are given for image pairs and triplets, for varying
                  motions between views, and for different scene
                  types. The methods are applicable to line/curve
                  matching in stereo and trinocular rigs, and as a
                  starting point for line/curve matching through
                  monocular image sequences. (65 References).}

  annote = {Physical simulation of dynamic objects has become commonplace in
computer graphics because it produces highly realistic animations. In this
paradigm the animator provides few physical parameters such as the objects'
initial positions and velocities, and the simulator automatically generates
realistic motions. The resulting motion, however, is difficult to control
because even a small adjustment of the input parameters can drastically
affect the subsequent motion. Furthermore, the animator often wishes to
change the end-result of the motion instead of the initial physical
parameters. We describe a novel interactive technique for intuitive
manipulation of rigid multi-body simulations. Using our system, the animator
can select bodies at any time and simply drag them to desired locations. In
response, the system computes the required physical parameters and simulates
the resulting motion. Surface characteristics such as normals and elasticity
coefficients can also be automatically adjusted to provide a greater range
of feasible motions, if the animator so desires. Because the entire
simulation editing process runs at interactive speeds, the animator can
rapidly design complex physical animations that would be difficult to
achieve with existing rigid body simulators. },

  annote = {Physical simulation of dynamic objects has become commonplace in
computer graphics because it produces highly realistic animations. In this
paradigm the animator provides few physical parameters such as the objects'
initial positions and velocities, and the simulator automatically generates
realistic motions. The resulting motion, however, is difficult to control
because even a small adjustment of the input parameters can drastically
affect the subsequent motion. Furthermore, the animator often wishes to
change the end-result of the motion instead of the initial physical
parameters. We describe a novel interactive technique for intuitive
manipulation of rigid multi-body simulations. Using our system, the animator
can select bodies at any time and simply drag them to desired locations. In
response, the system computes the required physical parameters and simulates
the resulting motion. Surface characteristics such as normals and elasticity
coefficients can also be automatically adjusted to provide a greater range
of feasible motions, if the animator so desires. Because the entire
simulation editing process runs at interactive speeds, the animator can
rapidly design complex physical animations that would be difficult to
achieve with existing rigid body simulators. },

@inproceedings{stein04incorporating,
	Abstract = {Current feature-based object recognition methods use information derived from local image patches. For robustness, features are engineered for invariance to various transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or affine warping. When patches overlap object boundaries, however, errors in both detection and matching will almost certainly occur due to inclusion of unwanted background pixels. This is common in real images, which often contain significant background clutter, objects which are not heavily textured, or objects which occupy a relatively small portion of the image. We suggest improvements to the popular Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) which incorporate local object boundary information. The resulting feature detection and descriptor creation processes are invariant to changes in background. We call this method the Background and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (BSIFT). We demonstrate BSIFT's superior performance in feature detection and matching
  on synthetic and natural images.

@article{wilson99parametric,
	Abstract = {A new method for the representation, recognition, and
     interpretation of parameterized gesture is presented. By
     parameterized gesture we mean gestures that exhibit a systematic
     spatial variation; one example is a point gesture where the
     relevant parameter is the two-dimensional direction. Our approach
     is to extend the standard hidden Markov model method of gesture
     recognition by including a global parametric variation in the
     output probabilities of the HMM states, Using a linear model of
     dependence, we formulate an expectation-maximization (EM) method
     for training the parametric HMM. During testing; a similar EM
     algorithm simultaneously maximizes the output likelihood of the
     PHMM for the given sequence and estimates the quantifying
     parameters. Using visually derived and directly measured
     three-dimensional hand position measurements as input, we present
     results that demonstrate the recognition superiority of the PHMM
     over standard HMM techniques, as well as greater robustness in
     parameter estimation with respect to noise in the input features.
     Last, we extend the PHMM to handle arbitrary smooth (nonlinear)
     dependencies. The nonlinear formulation requires the use of a
     generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm for both
     training and the simultaneous recognition of the gesture and
     estimation of the value of the parameter. We present results on a
     pointing gesture, where the nonlinear approach permits the natural
     spherical coordinate parameterization of pointing direction.},

@misc{mussa00motor,
	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss a new perspective on how the central nervous system (CNS) represents and solves some of the most fundamental computational problems of motor control. In particular, we consider the task of transforming a planned limb movement into an adequate set of motor commands. To carry out this task the CNS must solve a complex inverse dynamic problem. This problem involves the transformation from a desired motion to the forces that are needed to drive the limb. The inverse dynamic problem is a hard computational challenge because of the need to coordinate multiple limb segments and because of the continuous changes in the mechanical properties of the limbs and of the environment with which they come in contact. A number of studies of motor learning have provided support for the idea that the CNS creates, updates and exploits internal representations of limb dynamics in order to deal with the complexity of inverse dynamics. Here we discuss how such i
 nternal representations are likely to be built by combining the modular primitives in the spinal cord as well as other building blocks found in higher brain structures. Experimental studies on spinalized frogs and rats have led to the conclusion that the premotor circuits within the spinal cord are organized into a set of discrete modules. Each module, when activated, induces a specific force field and the simultaneous activation of multiple modules leads to the vectorial combination of the corresponding fields. We regard these force fields as computational primitives that are used by the CNS for generating a rich grammar of motor behaviours.},

@article{tsai01,
	Abstract = {In this work, we first address the problem of simultaneous
     image segmentation and smoothing by approaching the Mumford-Shah
     paradigm from a curve evolution perspective. In particular, we let
     a set of deformable contours define the boundaries between regions
     in an image where we model the data via piecewise smooth functions
     and employ a gradient flow to evolve these contours. Each gradient
     step involves solving an optimal estimation problem for the data
     within each region, connecting curve evolution and the
     Mumford-Shah functional with the theory of boundary-value
     stochastic processes. The resulting active contour model offers a
     tractable implementation of the original Mumford-Shah model (i.e.,
     without resorting to elliptic approximations which have
     traditionally been favored for greater ease in implementation) to
     simultaneously segment and smoothly reconstruct the data within a
     given image in a coupled manner. Various implementations of this
     algorithm are introduced to increase its speed of convergence. We
     also outline a hierarchical implementation of this algorithm to
     handle important image features such as triple points and other
     multiple junctions. Next, by generalizing the data fidelity term
     of the original Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate a spatially
     varying penalty, we extend our method to problems in which data
     quality varies across the image and to images in which sets of
     pixel measurements are missing. This more general model leads us
     to a novel PDE-based approach for simultaneous image
     magnification, segmentation, and smoothing, thereby extending the
     traditional applications of the Mumford-Shah functional which only
     considers simultaneous segmentation and smoothing.},

     variational methods for inference and learning in graphical models
     (Bayesian networks and Markov random fields). We present a number
     of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database,
     the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several
     variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run
     exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods,
     which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original
     graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which
     inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides
     bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We
     describe a general framework for generating variational
     transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the
     examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be

     the global region segmentation of a collection of calibrated
     images. We assume that the scene is composed of a number of smooth
     surfaces and a background, both of which support smooth Lambertian
     radiance functions. We formulate the problem in a variational
     framework, where the solution (both the shape and radiance of the
     scene) is a minimizer of a global cost functional which combines a
     geometric prior on shape, a smoothness prior on radiance and a
     data fitness score. We estimate the shape and radiance via an
     alternating minimization: The radiance is computed as the
     solutions of partial differential equations defined on the surface
     and the background. The shape is estimated using a gradient
     descent flow, which is implemented using the level set method. Our
     algorithm works for scenes with smooth radiances as well as fine
     homogeneous textures, which are known challenges to traditional
     stereo algorithms based on local correspondence.},

	Abstract = {We describe progress in matching shots which are images of
     the same 3D location in a film. The problem is hard because the
     camera viewpoint may change substantially between shots, with
     consequent changes in the imaged appearance of the scene due to
     foreshortening, scale changes, partial occlusion and lighting
     changes. We develop and compare two methods which achieve this
     task. In the first method we match key frames between shots using
     wide baseline matching techniques. The wide baseline method
     represents each fame by a set of viewpoint covariant local
     features. The local spatial support of the features means that
     segmentation of the frame (e.g., into foreground/background) is
     not required, and partial occlusion is tolerated. Matching
     proceeds through a series of stages starting with indexing based
     on a viewpoint invariant description of the features, then
     employing semi-local constraints (such as spatial consistency) and
     finally global constraints (such as epipolar geometry). In the
     second method the temporal continuity within a shot is used to
     compute invariant descriptors for tracked features, and these
     descriptors are the basic matching unit. The temporal information
     increases both the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the
     stability of the computed features. We develop analogues of local
     spatial consistency, cross-correlation, and epipolar geometry for
     these tracks. Results of matching shots for a number of very
     different scene types are illustrated on two entire commercial

@article{zhu03,
	Abstract = {Natural images contain an overwhelming number of visual
     patterns generated by diverse stochastic processes. Defining and
     modeling these patterns is of fundamental importance for generic
     vision tasks, such as perceptual organization, segmentation, and
     recognition. The objective of this epistemological paper is to
     summarize various threads of research in the literature and to
     pursue a unified framework for conceptualization, modeling,
     learning, and computing visual patterns. This paper starts with
     reviewing four research streams: 1) the study of image statistics,
     2) the analysis of image components, 3) the grouping of image
     elements, and 4) the modeling of visual patterns. The models from
     these research streams are then divided into four categories
     according to their semantic structures: 1) descriptive models,
     i.e., Markov random fields (MRF) or Gibbs, 2) variants of
     descriptive models (causal MRF and ``pseudodescriptive'' models), 3)
     generative models, and 4) discriminative models. The objectives,
     principles, theories, and typical models are reviewed in each
     category and the relationships between the four types of models
     are studied. Two central themes emerge from the relationship
     studies. 1) In representation, the integration of descriptive and
     generative models is the future direction for statistical modeling
     and should lead to richer and more advanced classes of vision
     models. 2) To make visual models computationally tractable,
     discriminative models are used as computational heuristics for
     inferring generative models. Thus, the roles of four types of
     models are clarified. The paper also addresses the issue of
     conceptualizing visual patterns and their components
     (vocabularies) from the perspective of statistical mechanics.
     Under this unified framework, a visual pattern is equalized to a
     statistical ensemble, and, furthermore, statistical models for
     various visual patterns form a "continuous" spectrum in the sense
     that they belong to a series of nested probability families in the
     space of attributed graphs.},

@article{ghahramani97,
	Abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the
     most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time
     series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed
     through a single discrete variable-the hidden state. We discuss a
     generalization of HMMs in which this state is factor-ed into
     multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a
     distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm far inferring
     the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given
     the observations, and relate it to the forward-backward algorithm
     for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Doe
     to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation,
     this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable
     systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs
     sampling or Variational methods. Within the variational framework,
     we present a structured approximation in which the the state
     variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for
     learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons
     suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide
     accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the
     structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that
     factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set
     which an unconstrained HMM cannot.},

     of two main tasks: the extraction of image content descriptions

     generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision

     paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving
     computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects

@article{donoho03,
	Abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying
     parametrization of scattered data (m(i)) lying on a manifold M
     embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method,
     Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual
     framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a
     Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space R-n, is
     locally isometric to an open, connected subset Theta of Euclidean
     space R-d. Because Theta does not have to be convex, this
     framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of
     situations than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical
     framework revolves around a quadratic form H(f) =
     integral(M)parallel toH(f)(m)parallel to(F)(2)dm defined on
     functions f : M --> R. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and H(f)
     averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the
     Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M.
     The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an
     open, connected subset of R-d, then H(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional
     null space consisting of the constant functions and a
     d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric
     coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up
     to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification
     of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a
     modification of the Laplacian eigen-maps framework, where we
     substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one
     based on the Laplacian.},

                  images up to a class of diffeomorphic
                  waprings. Warpings are built by composing elementary
                  warps from a dictionary. PAIRWISE WARPING A warp of
                  two images is built using a greedy optimization
                  procedure that concatenates one elementary warping
                  per time to the current estimate of the warping. The
                  interesting part: since the warpings in the
                  dictionary are local and act on circular regions,
                  the optimization procedure tries randomly a bunch of
                  positions and radii. GROUP-WISE WARPING A warp among
                  a set of images is built using a MDL
                  criterion. First, the pairwise warpings are
                  estimated. Then, the images from 1 to N-1 are used
                  to estimate the distributions of (1) the warped
                  images radiance and (2) the warped images pixel
                  positions. The logarithms of these distributions is
                  (proportional to) the number of bits needed to
                  encode image N as a pair <warped points, radiance>:
                  we recompute its warping to minimize this cost. This
                  procedure is repeated by taking out one image per
                  time until convergence. },

However, as the disparity becomes larger, the resulting dense correspondences will become increasingly inaccurate for everything but purely planar objects. Flexible motion models, on the other hand, tend to overfit and thus make partitioning difficult. For this reason, to achieve dense optical flow for image sequences with large inter-frame disparity, we propose a two stage process in which a planar model is used to get an approximation for the segmentation and the gross motion, and then a spline is used to refine the fit. We present experimental results for dense optical flow estimation on image pairs with large inter-frame disparity that are beyond the scope ofexistingapproaches. },

Appearance variations due to changing conditions are encoded by the correlations between the textons. We propose two solutions to model these correlations. The first one assumes locational independence. We call it the conditional texton distribution model. The second captures the second order variations across locations using Fisher linear discriminant analysis. We call it the Fisher texton model. Our two models are effective in the problem of face recognition from a single image across a wide range of illuminations, poses, and time. },

@inproceedings{triggs04detecting,
	Abstract = { Local feature approaches to vision geometry and object recognition are based on selecting and matching sparse sets of visually salient image points, known as keypoints or points of interest. Their performance depends critically on the accuracy and reliability with which corresponding keypoints can be found in subsequent images. Among the many existing keypoint selection criteria, the popular Forstner-Harris approach explicitly targets geometric stability, defining keypoints to be points that have locally maximal self-matching precision under translational least squares template matching. However, many applications require stability in orientation and scale as well as in position. Detecting translational keypoints and verifying orientation/scale behaviour post hoc is suboptimal, and can be misleading when different motion variables interact. We give a more principled formulation, based on extending the Forstner-Harris approach to general motion models and robust 
 template matching. We also incorporate a simple local appearance model to ensure good resistance to the most common illumination variations. We illustrate the resulting methods and quantify their performanceontestimages. },
	Annote = {Any cost function Q used to match patch pairs can be used to define a keypoint detector: the keypoints are the points where the cost function can localize in space/scale/ortientation the matching. An heuristic to detect such points is to check wether the cost function localizes the matching of the patch against itself: we move the patch (w.r.t. the useful coordinate, like space/scale/orientation, and w.r.t. the nuisance, like illumination) a little bit and we look at the variation of the cost function Q.  Then, we can search for the points where Q varies abruptly w.r.t the  coordinates that we want to localize when the nuisance are moved to maximize the localization uncertainty.

Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform , which measures local intensity, and the census transform , which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data.

    ABSTRACT =
{We  introduce
the concept of self-calibration of a 1D projective camera
from point correspondences,
and describe a method
for uniquely determining
the two internal parameters of a 1D camera
based on the trilinear tensor of three 1D images. The method requires
the estimation of the trilinear tensor which can be achieved linearly
with no approximation unlike  the trilinear tensor of 2D
images, and solving for the roots of a cubic polynomial in one variable.
 Interestingly enough,
we  prove that a 2D camera undergoing a planar motion
reduces to a 1D camera.
From this observation, we deduce a new method for self-calibrating a 2D
camera using planar motions.

Use the fact that images of Lambertian objects under varying illumination form linear subspaces -> Idea: find K polyhedial cones (or linear subspaces) that fit the data. "Illumination cones" is a bundle-like representation of objects under varying illumination. "Conic affinity" = distance in the equivalence class; the entire database is necessary in order to compute affinity between 2 images. Second method based on processing gradients; aims at small sensitivity (as opposed to invariance) to illumination. Pose is fixed. Exploits the fact that faces have very similar geometry; dismisses using this to estimate direction of incoming light (what if there are more light sources?).. Clustering is "unsupervised" (images are unlabeled). In the process they explain a positivity-constrained least-squares fitting, and a K-subspace clustering algorithm.}

@article{torralba03object,
	Abstract = {Object representations (geometric models, component based descriptions, view based representations, etc.) pay little or no attention to contextual features. Traditional approaches in object detection and recognition in computer vision consider an image as a collection of patches or regions that have to be classified. These techniques can be very fragile and slow, requiring exhaustive scanning of the image (in location and scale) and each object is recognized independently. Contextual information is known to have a big influence in object recognition by humans. The identification of scene views will provide strong priors for object identities, locations and points of views. Even in unfamiliar environments, the categorization of a scene (a street, an indoor, etc.) will constrain the presence and location of objects in the image. We show that scene features (obtained by pooling low-level features across the whole image) can be use to prime the presence/absence of objects in the scene and to predict their location, scale and appearance before exploring the image. We show how global image features can predict with 80% accuracy the presence/absence of animals and people in scenes without applying object detection mechanisms. In this scheme, visual context information is used early in the visual processing chain, in order to provide an efficient short cut for object detection and recognition.},

@inproceedings{stein04incorporating,
	Abstract = {Current feature-based object recognition methods use information derived from local image patches. For robustness, features are engineered for invariance to various transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or affine warping. When patches overlap object boundaries, however, errors in both detection and matching will almost certainly occur due to inclusion of unwanted background pixels. This is common in real images, which often contain significant background clutter, objects which are not heavily textured, or objects which occupy a relatively small portion of the image. We suggest improvements to the popular Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) which incorporate local object boundary information. The resulting feature detection and descriptor creation processes are invariant to changes in background. We call this method the Background and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (BSIFT). We demonstrate BSIFT's superior performance in feature detection and matching on synthetic and natural images.

@article{wilson99parametric,
	Abstract = {A new method for the representation, recognition, and
     interpretation of parameterized gesture is presented. By
     parameterized gesture we mean gestures that exhibit a systematic
     spatial variation; one example is a point gesture where the
     relevant parameter is the two-dimensional direction. Our approach
     is to extend the standard hidden Markov model method of gesture
     recognition by including a global parametric variation in the
     output probabilities of the HMM states, Using a linear model of
     dependence, we formulate an expectation-maximization (EM) method
     for training the parametric HMM. During testing; a similar EM
     algorithm simultaneously maximizes the output likelihood of the
     PHMM for the given sequence and estimates the quantifying
     parameters. Using visually derived and directly measured
     three-dimensional hand position measurements as input, we present
     results that demonstrate the recognition superiority of the PHMM
     over standard HMM techniques, as well as greater robustness in
     parameter estimation with respect to noise in the input features.
     Last, we extend the PHMM to handle arbitrary smooth (nonlinear)
     dependencies. The nonlinear formulation requires the use of a
     generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm for both
     training and the simultaneous recognition of the gesture and
     estimation of the value of the parameter. We present results on a
     pointing gesture, where the nonlinear approach permits the natural
     spherical coordinate parameterization of pointing direction.},

@misc{mussa00motor,
	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss a new perspective on how the central nervous system (CNS) represents and solves some of the most fundamental computational problems of motor control. In particular, we consider the task of transforming a planned limb movement into an adequate set of motor commands. To carry out this task the CNS must solve a complex inverse dynamic problem. This problem involves the transformation from a desired motion to the forces that are needed to drive the limb. The inverse dynamic problem is a hard computational challenge because of the need to coordinate multiple limb segments and because of the continuous changes in the mechanical properties of the limbs and of the environment with which they come in contact. A number of studies of motor learning have provided support for the idea that the CNS creates, updates and exploits internal representations of limb dynamics in order to deal with the complexity of inverse dynamics. Here we discuss how such internal representations are likely to be built by combining the modular primitives in the spinal cord as well as other building blocks found in higher brain structures. Experimental studies on spinalized frogs and rats have led to the conclusion that the premotor circuits within the spinal cord are organized into a set of discrete modules. Each module, when activated, induces a specific force field and the simultaneous activation of multiple modules leads to the vectorial combination of the corresponding fields. We regard these force fields as computational primitives that are used by the CNS for generating a rich grammar of motor behaviours.},

@article{tsai01,
	Abstract = {In this work, we first address the problem of simultaneous
     image segmentation and smoothing by approaching the Mumford-Shah
     paradigm from a curve evolution perspective. In particular, we let
     a set of deformable contours define the boundaries between regions
     in an image where we model the data via piecewise smooth functions
     and employ a gradient flow to evolve these contours. Each gradient
     step involves solving an optimal estimation problem for the data
     within each region, connecting curve evolution and the
     Mumford-Shah functional with the theory of boundary-value
     stochastic processes. The resulting active contour model offers a
     tractable implementation of the original Mumford-Shah model (i.e.,
     without resorting to elliptic approximations which have
     traditionally been favored for greater ease in implementation) to
     simultaneously segment and smoothly reconstruct the data within a
     given image in a coupled manner. Various implementations of this
     algorithm are introduced to increase its speed of convergence. We
     also outline a hierarchical implementation of this algorithm to
     handle important image features such as triple points and other
     multiple junctions. Next, by generalizing the data fidelity term
     of the original Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate a spatially
     varying penalty, we extend our method to problems in which data
     quality varies across the image and to images in which sets of
     pixel measurements are missing. This more general model leads us
     to a novel PDE-based approach for simultaneous image
     magnification, segmentation, and smoothing, thereby extending the
     traditional applications of the Mumford-Shah functional which only
     considers simultaneous segmentation and smoothing.},

	Abstract = {We describe progress in matching shots which are images of
     the same 3D location in a film. The problem is hard because the
     camera viewpoint may change substantially between shots, with
     consequent changes in the imaged appearance of the scene due to
     foreshortening, scale changes, partial occlusion and lighting
     changes. We develop and compare two methods which achieve this
     task. In the first method we match key frames between shots using
     wide baseline matching techniques. The wide baseline method
     represents each fame by a set of viewpoint covariant local
     features. The local spatial support of the features means that
     segmentation of the frame (e.g., into foreground/background) is
     not required, and partial occlusion is tolerated. Matching
     proceeds through a series of stages starting with indexing based
     on a viewpoint invariant description of the features, then
     employing semi-local constraints (such as spatial consistency) and
     finally global constraints (such as epipolar geometry). In the
     second method the temporal continuity within a shot is used to
     compute invariant descriptors for tracked features, and these
     descriptors are the basic matching unit. The temporal information
     increases both the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the
     stability of the computed features. We develop analogues of local
     spatial consistency, cross-correlation, and epipolar geometry for
     these tracks. Results of matching shots for a number of very
     different scene types are illustrated on two entire commercial

@article{zhu03,
	Abstract = {Natural images contain an overwhelming number of visual
     patterns generated by diverse stochastic processes. Defining and
     modeling these patterns is of fundamental importance for generic
     vision tasks, such as perceptual organization, segmentation, and
     recognition. The objective of this epistemological paper is to
     summarize various threads of research in the literature and to
     pursue a unified framework for conceptualization, modeling,
     learning, and computing visual patterns. This paper starts with
     reviewing four research streams: 1) the study of image statistics,
     2) the analysis of image components, 3) the grouping of image
     elements, and 4) the modeling of visual patterns. The models from
     these research streams are then divided into four categories
     according to their semantic structures: 1) descriptive models,
     i.e., Markov random fields (MRF) or Gibbs, 2) variants of
     descriptive models (causal MRF and ``pseudodescriptive'' models), 3)
     generative models, and 4) discriminative models. The objectives,
     principles, theories, and typical models are reviewed in each
     category and the relationships between the four types of models
     are studied. Two central themes emerge from the relationship
     studies. 1) In representation, the integration of descriptive and
     generative models is the future direction for statistical modeling
     and should lead to richer and more advanced classes of vision
     models. 2) To make visual models computationally tractable,
     discriminative models are used as computational heuristics for
     inferring generative models. Thus, the roles of four types of
     models are clarified. The paper also addresses the issue of
     conceptualizing visual patterns and their components
     (vocabularies) from the perspective of statistical mechanics.
     Under this unified framework, a visual pattern is equalized to a
     statistical ensemble, and, furthermore, statistical models for
     various visual patterns form a "continuous" spectrum in the sense
     that they belong to a series of nested probability families in the
     space of attributed graphs.},

@article{ghahramani97,
	Abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the
     most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time
     series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed
     through a single discrete variable-the hidden state. We discuss a
     generalization of HMMs in which this state is factor-ed into
     multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a
     distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm far inferring
     the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given
     the observations, and relate it to the forward-backward algorithm
     for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Doe
     to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation,
     this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable
     systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs
     sampling or Variational methods. Within the variational framework,
     we present a structured approximation in which the the state
     variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for
     learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons
     suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide
     accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the
     structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that
     factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set
     which an unconstrained HMM cannot.},

     identify objects in the scene or for stereoscopic matching or
     displacement vector measuring. In a previous work, an accurate

     a general junction model that allows us to better understand the
     behavior of junctions in the wavelet domain. Two new properties,
     including the scale proportion property of the modulus and the
     scale invariant property of orientation in the wavelet domain, are
     derived. These properties are applied to accurately detect
     junctions. Several promising experimental results have been
     carried out using noisy and noisy-free real images. These results

     of two main tasks: the extraction of image content descriptions

     level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is
     generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision
     layers in the Human Visual System are context independent. This
     paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving
     computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects
     of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In
     contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks,
     we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based
     on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of

     matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and

@article{donoho03,
	Abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying
     parametrization of scattered data (m(i)) lying on a manifold M
     embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method,
     Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual
     framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a
     Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space R-n, is
     locally isometric to an open, connected subset Theta of Euclidean
     space R-d. Because Theta does not have to be convex, this
     framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of
     situations than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical
     framework revolves around a quadratic form H(f) =
     integral(M)parallel toH(f)(m)parallel to(F)(2)dm defined on
     functions f : M --> R. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and H(f)
     averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the
     Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M.
     The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an
     open, connected subset of R-d, then H(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional
     null space consisting of the constant functions and a
     d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric
     coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up
     to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification
     of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a
     modification of the Laplacian eigen-maps framework, where we
     substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one
     based on the Laplacian.},

However, as the disparity becomes larger, the resulting dense correspondences will become increasingly inaccurate for everything but purely planar objects. Flexible motion models, on the other hand, tend to overfit and thus make partitioning difficult. For this reason, to achieve dense optical flow for image sequences with large inter-frame disparity, we propose a two stage process in which a planar model is used to get an approximation for the segmentation and the gross motion, and then a spline is used to refine the fit. We present experimental results for dense optical flow estimation on image pairs with large inter-frame disparity that are beyond the scope ofexistingapproaches. },

	Abstract = { Local feature approaches to vision geometry and object recognition are based on selecting and matching sparse sets of visually salient image points, known as keypoints or points of interest. Their performance depends critically on the accuracy and reliability with which corresponding keypoints can be found in subsequent images. Among the many existing keypoint selection criteria, the popular Forstner-Harris approach explicitly targets geometric stability, defining keypoints to be points that have locally maximal self-matching precision under translational least squares template matching. However, many applications require stability in orientation and scale as well as in position. Detecting translational keypoints and verifying orientation/scale behaviour post hoc is suboptimal, and can be misleading when different motion variables interact. We give a more principled formulation, based on extending the Forstner-Harris approach to general motion models and robust template matching. We also incorporate a simple local appearance model to ensure good resistance to the most common illumination variations. We illustrate the resulting methods and quantify their performanceontestimages. },

An heuristic to detect such points is to check wether the cost function localizes the matching of the patch against itself: we move the patch (w.r.t. the useful coordinate, like space/scale/orientation, and w.r.t. the nuisance, like illumination) a little bit and we look at the variation of the cost function Q.  Then, we can search for the points where Q varies abruptly w.r.t the  coordinates that we want to localize when the nuisance are moved to maximize the localization uncertainty.

@inproceedings{zabih94nonparametric,
	Abstract = {We propose a new approach to the correspondence problem that makes use of non-parametric local transforms as the basis for correlation. Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform , which measures local intensity, and the census transform , which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data.

notes = {Addresses object exploration task, concerning "detached objects" as opposed to environment where viewer is immersed. Goal is to design strategies that provably make every point in the object visible; use deformation of occluding boundary, assumed measured through range sensors. Focus of exploration is estimation of 3D shape, so in the absence of range sensor show can only explore non-concave objects. A room is a concave object. Given photometric information (images) it is possible to reconstruct concave objects, assuming they have non-constant radiance (which they almost always do, even if albedo is constant, due to illumination; this is true even in the presence of diffuse illumination, due to vignetting). Even in the presence of image measurements, assume that occluding boundary has been detected. This is highly non-trivial.}

  abstract = {Our goal is to create a visual odometry system for robots and wearable
       systems such that localization accuracies of centimeters can be
       obtained for hundreds of meters of distance traveled. Existing
       systems have achieved approximately a 1\% to 5\% localization
       error rate whereas our proposed system achieves close to 0.1\%
       error rate, a ten-fold reduction. Traditional visual odometry
       systems drift over time as the frame-to-frame errors
       accumulate. In this paper, we propose to improve visual
       odometry using visual landmarks in the scene. First, a dynamic
       local landmark tracking technique is proposed to track a set of
       local landmarks across image frames and select an optimal set
       of tracked local landmarks for pose computation. As a result,
       the error associated with each pose computation is minimized to
       reduce the drift significantly. Second, a global landmark based
       drift correction technique is proposed to recognize previously
       visited locations and use them to correct drift accumulated
       during motion. At each visited location along the route, a set
       of distinctive visual landmarks is automatically extracted and
       inserted into a landmark database dynamically. We integrate the
       landmark based approach into a navigation system with 2 stereo
       pairs and a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for
       increased robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual
       odometry system using local and global landmarks can precisely
       locate a user within 1 meter over 1000 meters in unknown
       indoor/outdoor environments with challenging situations such as
       climbing stairs, opening doors, moving foreground objects etc..},
