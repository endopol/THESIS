If $F$ is also differentiable and $F'$ is bijective, we obtain an explicit formula in terms of a median. This enables us to obtain approximate solutions to certain important variational problems arising in image denoising. We also present a generalization with $E(x)= J(x)+ F(x)$ for $J(x)$ a convex piecewise differentiable function with a finite number of nondifferentiable points.},
