\section{Information-Driven Exploration}

Exploration is a Partially-Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP).
$$\min_{\text{Policies $\pi$}}\sum $$


policy with the shortest expected \footnote{or shortest worst-case}
\begin{example}
Lost Astronaut:
An astronaut crash-lands at an unknown location on the Earth's surface, 
having only a prior distribution on latitude, derived from the trajectory of
her satellite (Fig. \ref{fig: lost astronaut}.
Needing to know her exact location, and having broken her navigation equipment, 
she examines local landmarks.
Her prior knowledge of the situation informs her initial reconnaisance.  
For instance, as her longitude is more uncertain than her latitude,
it would be a better use of her time to try to ascertain the former, by, 
for instance, checking the passage of the sun against her watch.

\caption{\emph{Lost Astronaut Prior Distribution}
The crash site $\x(t)$ is defined by a random time $t$, chosen uniformly in $[0,T]$.
This induces prior marginal probabilities on the latitude and longitude of the crash site.
The limiting distribution for as $T\to\infty$ is shown at right, while the limiting distribution
on longitude is uniform.

In the first case, the explorer knows that 
there are four identical boxes scattered within a
room of known dimensions, three of which he can see.
