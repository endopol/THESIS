Comparison with an exponential decay curve shows that penetration can be accurately modeled by an exponential distribution, indexed by a single, computable, ``Mean Free Path'' parameter. As these Statistics scale with Poisson-Disc radius, they only need to be computed once for the entire family of Possion-Disc Voronoi Partitions. }}{1}}
